# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

A credit card fraud detection project aims to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions within credit card networks. Here's a summary of the project stages:

 **Data Collection:** Gather historical transaction data, including details such as transaction amount, merchant, location, time, and user account information.

 **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse, preprocess, and transform the data, handling missing values and outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to understand patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud. EDA helps in feature selection and understanding the characteristics of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

 **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's ability to detect fraud. This may involve aggregating transaction data, calculating transaction frequency, or deriving behavioral patterns.

 **Model Selection and Training:** Used machine learning algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest. 

 **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall,and F1-score. 

By implementing an effective fraud detection system, financial institutions can mitigate risks, protect customers, and safeguard their assets from fraudulent activities.
